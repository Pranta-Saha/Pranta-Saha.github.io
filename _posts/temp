This post might not seem useful but I've been researching a lot about CS lately and instead of bookmarking and finding the course links from the browser, I thought an article containing all the links would be good which I can share with my friends later. 

I'll be adding new ones while taking the MOOCs on my free time. Hope I have extra time to take the MOOCs along with classes that I take.
